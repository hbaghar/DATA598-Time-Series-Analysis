```{r}
library(tseries)
library(astsa)
library(forecast)
```


```{r}
car.df <- read.csv("Week 3/CAR_exports.csv")
head(car.df)
str(car.df)
```
Converting to time series object:
```{r}
car.ts <- ts(car.df, frequency = 1, start = c(1960))
plot(car.ts)
```
Check for stationarity:

Above plot shows that the series is non-stationary, due to the downward trend. Let's do an extra test to make sure
```{r}
kpss.test(car.ts)
```
We see that the series is non-stationary based on p-value.
